*   **Website Url:** https://www.fitproperty.com/
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (Specific count not readily available, but student properties are clearly listed and categorized by room size on the website)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove, Zoopla, UniHomes (Listings found on Rightmove and Zoopla via search. UniHomes partnership mentioned on their website. Not found on OnTheMarket via search.)
*   **Branches:** 1 (Based on website and search results indicating a single Sheffield address)
*   **Key Contact Person (e.g., Director/Manager):**
    *   **Full Name:** Not Found (Specific Director/Manager name not easily identifiable from website or search results. An article mentions Adam Paling was a director previously, and another mentions Joel Walker was Head of Property Management, but current leadership isn't clear.)
    *   **Position:** Not Found

    *   **Phone:** 01142 725773 (from website) / 0114 697 2820 (from Rightmove/Home.co.uk) / 0114 446 0138 (from allAgents)

2025-04-15 13:11:58,327 - INFO - Full response for M3 Lettings:
Okay, I will now research M3 Lettings based on the provided information and publicly available online data.

**Letting Agent:** M3 Lettings

**Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Listings viewed mention 'Bills included', but it doesn't appear to be universal across all properties)

**Website Url:** https://www.m3lettings.com/

**Student Listings Live:** Yes (Dedicated student section on website with multiple listings visible)

**Key channels live on:** Rightmove, OnTheMarket (Zoopla results were for other agents in the M3 postcode, not M3 Lettings specifically. No results found for UniHomes)

**Branches:** 1 (Based in Sheffield, despite the user prompt mentioning Manchester - the website and search results confirm Sheffield)

**Key Contact Person (e.g., Director/Manager):**
*   **Full Name:** Michael Monaghan
*   **Position:** Managing Director

**Contact Information:**
*   **Phone:** 0114 488 8105 (Found on OnTheMarket profile and Yell) *Note: The website contact form doesn't list a direct number.*
*   **Address:** 74 Barber Road, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S10 1EE (Found on OnTheMarket profile and Yell) *Note: The website only mentions being in Crookesmoor, Sheffield.*
*   **Email:** Not Found (Website has a contact form only)

**LinkedIn:** Not Found (No specific profile found for Michael Monaghan linked to M3 Lettings. Search results for 'Moosa Ahmed' appear unrelated to this specific M3 Lettings agency based in Sheffield).

**Other Linkedin/Extra Details:**
*   Company LinkedIn: Not Found
*   Companies House: M3 LETTINGS LIMITED (Company number 05691024)

**Notes/Comments:**
*   The agency name and URL provided seemed to point towards Manchester (M3 postcode), but all reliable search results (Google, OnTheMarket, Yell, Agency Website 'About Us') firmly place M3 Lettings in **Sheffield**, specifically Crookesmoor. The key contact and address reflect the Sheffield location.
*   The Managing Director's name (Michael Monaghan) was found via their OnTheMarket profile and confirmed on the agency's website 'About Us' page.
*   Contact details like phone and specific address were more readily available on third-party sites (OnTheMarket, Yell) than the agency's own website.
*   Difficulty finding a direct email address or relevant LinkedIn profiles.

Okay, here is the research report for JC Sales and Lettings based on the provided information and online search results.

Found listings mentioning bills included options, especially for students.
