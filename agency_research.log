Here is the research summary for Fit Property Lettings Agent:

*   **Letting Agent:** Fit Property Lettings Agent
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (The website mentions a 'Bills Managed' service for landlords, indicating some properties may offer bills included, and Rightmove listings mention a 'bills inclusive package available' on some properties.)
*   **Website Url:** https://www.fitproperty.com/
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (The website has dedicated sections for student accommodation by room size and mentions student lettings specifically. Reviews also confirm they cater to students.)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove, Zoopla, UniHomes (Mentioned on their website footer), OnTheMarket (Mentioned on allAgents profile)
*   **Branches:** 1 (Based on website contact information and search results)
*   **Key Contact Person (e.g., Director/Manager):**

    *   **Position:** Director / Former Head of Property Management
*   **Contact Information:**
    *   **Phone:** 01142 725773 (from website) / 0114 697 2820 (from Rightmove/Home.co.uk) / 0114 446 0138 (from allAgents)
    *   **Address:** 144 Charles Street, Sheffield S1 2NE (from website & allAgents) / 100, Matilda Street, Sheffield, S1 4QF (from Home.co.uk - likely an old address)
    *   **Email:** hello@fitproperty.com
*   **LinkedIn:** Not Found (No specific profile found for Adam Divers or Joel Walker linked directly to Fit Property via search. No company page readily found.)
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** A news article mentions Joel Walker was previously Head of Property Management at Fit Property before moving to Spicerhaart Lettings. An article about StudentTenant mentions Adam Divers as a director of Fit Property.
*   **Notes/Comments:** Multiple phone numbers and addresses were found across different sources; the details from the official website (Charles Street address and 01142 725773 phone) are likely the most current. Identifying current key management directly from search or the website was difficult; external articles provided names of individuals associated with director/management roles. The website explicitly mentions offering a 'Bills Managed' service, suggesting bills-inclusive options are available for some properties.

Okay, here is the research summary for JC Sales and Lettings based on the search results:

*   **Letting Agent:** JC Sales and Lettings
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Search results show listings with 'Bills Included Option Available' and some with specific bills like Council Tax, Gas, and Water included. Their student lettings page also mentions 'All Inclusive and Rent Only contracts are available'.)
*   **Website Url:** https://www.jc-lettings.com/
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (The website has a dedicated 'Properties for Students' section, and search results confirm student listings, including options for bills included.)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove, Zoopla, PrimeLocation (OnTheMarket and UniHomes presence not explicitly confirmed for *JC Sales and Lettings* in Sheffield, though their student arm mentions a UniHomes partnership badge and OnTheMarket results appeared for a similarly named agency in Scunthorpe).
*   **Branches:** 1 (The primary address found is in Sheffield. While they mention acquiring 'Sheffield Student Properties', this appears integrated into the main operation rather than a separate branch. Search results also show a 'JC Property Management Sales & Lettings' in Scunthorpe, but this seems to be a separate, unaffiliated family-run business established earlier.)
*   **Key Contact Person (e.g., Director/Manager):**
    *   **Full Name:** Christian Kleeli / Joseph Worrall-Kenny
    *   **Position:** Director(s) (Established by Christian Kleeli & Joseph Worrall-Kenny, referred to as company Directors.)
*   **Contact Information:**
    *   **Phone:** 0114 446 2172 (Zoopla/PrimeLocation), 0114 697 9773 (Lettings - Rightmove), 0114 2666300 (Student Lettings), 07518 712 380 (Student Enquiries Mobile), 07799 281 491 (Sales Mobile)

    *   **Email:** students@jc-lettings.com (Student Lettings). General email not found in search results, requires website check.
*   **LinkedIn:** Not Found (No specific LinkedIn profiles for Christian Kleeli or Joseph Worrall-Kenny associated with JC Sales and Lettings found in search results. A LinkedIn result appeared for 'JC Property Management, Sales & Lettings' in Scunthorpe, but this seems to be the separate agency.)
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** JC Sales and Lettings is a trading name of JC Lettings and Property Management Limited (Company number: 14135919). They acquired/merged with 'Sheffield Student Properties'.
*   **Notes/Comments:** There is another agency named "JC Property Management Sales & Lettings" based in Scunthorpe, established in 2007, which appears distinct from the target agency "JC Sales and Lettings" in Sheffield (established by Christian Kleeli & Joseph Worrall-Kenny). Care was taken to differentiate between the two. The Sheffield agency focuses on combining corporate practices with personal director involvement. Multiple phone numbers and two addresses (Registered/Main and Student Lettings) were found. A general contact email wasn't readily available via search.

*   **Letting Agent:** Thornsett Properties
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Their website mentions bills-inclusive options are offered on the majority of properties, either directly or via UniHomes, often with a fair usage policy. Some Rightmove listings explicitly state bills included, while others don't.)
*   **Website Url:** https://www.thornsett.com/
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (The agency website heavily features student accommodation in Sheffield. A specific count isn't readily available from search results.)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove (Listings found via search and mentioned on their site). Zoopla (No specific listings found via `site:` search, but Zoopla search results for *property* in Thornsett village appear, which is unrelated). OnTheMarket (No listings found via `site:` search). UniHomes (Mentioned on their website as a partner for bills-inclusive packages).
*   **Branches:** 1 (Main office listed as City Centre Office, Croft Buildings, 70 Campo Lane, Sheffield. A Crookesmoor office address is listed as 'by appointment only' and is also the registered company address.)
*   **Key Contact Person (e.g., Director/Manager):**
    *   **Full Name:** Tony Choker (Listed as Director on Endole and mentioned in testimonials) / Chris Green (Listed as Director on website 'Meet the Team' page - *Note: Multiple directors likely exist, including Satnam Singh Choker, Charanjit Singh Choker, Sarabjit Kaur Choker based on Companies House/Endole data*)
    *   **Position:** Director
*   **Contact Information:**
    *   **Phone:** 0114 266 9700 (Found on website and search results)
    *   **Address:** City Centre Office: Croft Buildings, 70 Campo Lane, Sheffield, S1 2EG (Main contact address from website) / Registered Address: 195 Crookes Valley Road, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, S10 1BA (From Companies House/Endole and website 'by appointment only' office)
    *   **Email:** info@thornsett.com (Inferred from website 'Click to e-mail' link) or via website contact form.
*   **LinkedIn:**
    *   **Key Contact:** Not Found (No public profile readily found for Tony Choker or Chris Green associated with Thornsett Properties via search).
    *   **Company Page:** https://www.linkedin.com/company/thornsett-properties/ (Found via search and linked on some directory sites)
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:**
    *   The company is formally registered as THORNSETT PROPERTIES LIMITED (Company number 03867500).
    *   Endole lists multiple directors associated with the company name.
    *   They state they are property owners, not just letting agents.
    *   They have an in-house maintenance team.
    *   Active on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube.
*   **Notes/Comments:** Information primarily sourced from the agency website and company information directories (Endole, Companies House). Identifying a single 'key' contact is difficult due to multiple directors listed; Tony Choker and Chris Green appear in different contexts (testimonials/website team page). Portal presence seems focused on Rightmove and potentially direct bookings/UniHomes partnerships rather than broad Zoopla/OTM coverage based on search results. Bills policy is 'Some' rather than a definite Yes/No across all properties. Thornsett also appears involved in property development projects beyond lettings (e.g., Purley, London projects mentioned in search results).
