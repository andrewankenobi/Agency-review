*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** JC Sales and Lettings is a trading name of JC Lettings and Property Management Limited. Company number: 14135919. VAT Number: 415 8145 04.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency operates primarily in Sheffield and South Yorkshire, with a focus on both sales and lettings, including student properties. They emphasize director-level involvement and personal service. Contact details differ slightly between the main site and the student property section/different branches. The provided website URL leads to the Sheffield-based agency. There appears to be another "JC Property Management, Sales & Lettings" in Scunthorpe (DN15) and a "JC Sales & Lettings" in Leicester, which seem distinct from the Sheffield agency. The search results primarily focused on the Sheffield agency as per the website provided. Listing counts on portals were difficult to ascertain accurately via search alone.
