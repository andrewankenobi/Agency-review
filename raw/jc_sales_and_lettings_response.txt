*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Number: 14135919 (JC Lettings and Property Management Limited), VAT Number: 415 8145 04. The agency also operates under the name "Sheffield Student Property".
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency was established by Christian Kleeli & Joseph Worrall-Kenny. They have a strong focus on student accommodation in Sheffield, operating the "Sheffield Student Property" brand from their Ecclesall Road office. They offer both sales and lettings services. Found conflicting phone numbers for the Dore office (0114 483 0038 on website vs 0114 697 3563/0114 697 9773 on Rightmove). Used website numbers. Found a "JC Property Management Sales & Lettings" in Scunthorpe (DN15) on Zoopla and OnTheMarket, and a "JC Property Management" in Huntingdale, Australia, but these appear unrelated to the Sheffield-based JC Sales and Lettings.
