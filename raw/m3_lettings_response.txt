*   **Notes/Comments:** M3 Lettings appears to be a small, independent, family-run business established in 2007, specializing in the Sheffield student property market, particularly in the Crookesmoor area. Many listings highlight bills being included. The Managing Director, Michael Monaghan, is mentioned frequently. Found conflicting company numbers, potentially indicating related entities or a change over time. Limited presence found on major property portals besides their own website and OnTheMarket.
