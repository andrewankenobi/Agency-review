*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student accommodation in Sheffield. Finding specific portal listings or LinkedIn profiles was difficult due to the common name "Igloo" being used by multiple unrelated accommodation businesses globally (e.g., Iglu in Australia, Igloo Regeneration, Igloo Hostels, Igloo Holiday Homes). The contact details and company number are confirmed via their website and Companies House. Bills are generally not included, but packages can be arranged.
