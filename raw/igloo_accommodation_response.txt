*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield, catering to groups and individuals. Offers properties from 1 to 10 bedrooms.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses heavily on the student market in Sheffield, with properties near both universities. While standard listings don't include bills, they offer assistance in setting up inclusive packages. No presence found on major UK property portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket) via search. Several other businesses use "Igloo" or "Iglu" for accommodation (Australia, Aviemore, Nottingham, France, Finland), but the Sheffield agency appears distinct. No specific key contact person identified from website or search results.
