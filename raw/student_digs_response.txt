*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student accommodation (houses, flats, studios, rooms) primarily in Leicester but also lists properties in Chester, Nottingham, and Sheffield. They offer bills-inclusive options on many properties. Contact details are readily available on their website. No specific key contact person was identified through the search. Listing presence confirmed on Rightmove, but not definitively on Zoopla or OTM for this specific agency (studentdigs.uk). Endole lists the operating company "My Student Digs Limited" as dissolved, which conflicts with the active website and current listings.
