*   **Notes/Comments:** The website provided (https://homeaccommodation.co.uk) appears to be a placeholder or under construction, containing no specific details about the letting agency's services, listings, or contact information beyond the company name. Most information found relates to a registered company "HOME ACCOMMODATION LIMITED" via Companies House. No active property listings were found on major portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket) under this name. There is another company, "@ HOME ACCOMMODATION SERVICES LTD" (Company number 06677035), but this seems distinct.
