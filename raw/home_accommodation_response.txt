*   **Letting Agent:** Home Accommodation
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Not Found (The website focuses on student accommodation in Sheffield. While many student accommodations include bills [9, 11, 16, 34, 35, 39, 40], the website itself doesn't explicitly state if *all* their listings are bills-inclusive. Some general sources state bills are often included in student lets [16, 34], while others mention listings both with and without bills [27].)
*   **Website Url:** https://homeaccommodation.co.uk
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes [3]
*   **Key channels live on:** Not Found (While general student letting portals like Rightmove Student, Zoopla, OnTheMarket, and UniHomes exist [11, 19, 27, 38], there's no specific mention of Home Accommodation listing on them in the search results.)

*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** The website specifies they are *not* @Home Accommodation Ltd (London) [3]. There is a "HOME ACCOMMODATION LIMITED" registered on Companies House (Company number 14729317) with a different address in Stevenage, Hertfordshire [8], it's unclear if this is the same entity as the Sheffield-based agency.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency appears to specialize in student accommodation specifically in Sheffield [3]. Finding details beyond the basic contact information on their website was difficult. No key personnel or specific portal listings were identified. The distinction from a London-based company with a similar name is noted on their contact page [3].
