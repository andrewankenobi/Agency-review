There are other agencies with similar names, e.g., William H Brown, HW Estate Agents, Whitlock and Heaps, and a WH Properties in Nashville, TN, USA, but none match the provided website/UK context).

*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** The agency appears to specialize in student accommodation in Sheffield. They state they do not charge administration fees to tenants. Rent payment is requested via post-dated cheques.
*   **Notes/Comments:** Information is scarce. The website (whproperties.co.uk) focuses heavily on student lettings in Sheffield. It lacks standard contact details like a phone number or address, relying on a web form. No presence found on major UK property portals or LinkedIn under this name. There is a "WH Properties Holding Ltd" registered in the UK, but it's unclear if it's related. Several US-based entities and other UK agencies (like William H Brown) share similar names, causing confusion in search results.
