*   **Letting Agent:** WH Properties
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (The website mentions "Sheffield University Student Accommodation Bills Included" on a page title [20], and general search results indicate 'bills included' is a common feature, especially for student lets [18, 19], but it's not explicitly confirmed for all listings on their site.)
*   **Website Url:** https://whproperties.co.uk
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (The website has sections and page titles specifically mentioning student accommodation [20, 23].)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove (Not Found), Zoopla (Not Found), OnTheMarket (Not Found) (Search results often show William H Brown or other similarly named agencies on these portals [14, 21, 26, 31, 40, 41, 44, 45], but not specifically WH Properties at whproperties.co.uk. A TikTok result mentions Rightmove in relation to a WH Properties Sheffield listing [38], but direct portal listings weren't confirmed.)
*   **Branches:** Not Found (Appears to be a single location based on contact details.)

    *   Key Contact Profile URL: Not Found
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Name potentially "Lindsay & Lisa Wiseman" trading as WH Properties [23]. There is a registered company "WH PROPERTIES LTD" [46], but it's unclear if it's the same entity without further details like company number or address matching. Another company "WH Properties Holding Ltd" also exists [32].
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency appears to specialize in student accommodation in Sheffield, particularly for Sheffield University students [20, 23]. The contact details point to Lisa and Lindsay Wiseman as key individuals. Difficulty arose in distinguishing this specific "WH Properties" from others with similar names (e.g., William H Brown [17], Whitlock and Heaps [9], WH Property Management [34], WH Properties in Nashville [3, 29, 30]) and confirming their presence on major UK property portals.
