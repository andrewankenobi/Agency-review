They offer properties with bills included and excluded options. Key contact appears to be Lindsay Wiseman, with Lisa Wiseman also mentioned (potentially involved in management/data control). No presence found on major UK property portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket) during this search. Several other companies named "WH Properties" exist in different locations (Nashville, Costa del Sol, Milwaukee) and sectors (auctioneering), unrelated to the specified UK letting agent. There is also a "WHB Student Lets" in Canterbury, which is different.
