*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses heavily on student lettings in Leicester and Portsmouth, but also offers general lettings, management, commercial, and block management services across several UK cities. They mention managing properties in London, Essex, Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, and Manchester as well. Some listings explicitly state "All Inclusive Bills", particularly for student accommodation. Found conflicting information on the number of branches (some sources say 2, but the website lists 3 distinct office addresses and phone numbers). No direct LinkedIn profiles were found in the search results.
