*   **Notes/Comments:** Strawberry Student Homes appears to be a landlord owning and managing their own properties primarily in the Ecclesall Road area of Sheffield, rather than a traditional letting agent. They focus on student accommodation for Sheffield Hallam and University of Sheffield students. Listings were found on their own website and StuRents, but not on the major UK portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) during this search. Some search results referred to "Strawberry Place" or "Strawberry Hill" which are different student accommodation providers/locations.
