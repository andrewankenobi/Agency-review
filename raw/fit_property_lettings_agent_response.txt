*   **Letting Agent:** Fit Property Lettings Agent
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Their website mentions student properties, and some student lettings often include bills, but it's not explicitly stated as standard across all listings. General articles found discuss the pros/cons of bills included, suggesting it's a variable feature in the market.)
*   **Website Url:** https://www.fitproperty.com/
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (The website explicitly mentions marketing "luxury student housing/accommodation" and has sections dedicated to student properties by number of beds.)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove (28 listings found via Home.co.uk), Zoopla (Not Found), OnTheMarket (Not Found)
*   **Branches:** 1 (The address listed is singular: 144 Charles Street, Sheffield S1 2NE. Home.co.uk also lists an address at 100 Matilda Street, Sheffield, S1 4QF, but the primary contact address on their website is Charles Street. It's likely one main office.)
*   **Key Contact Person:**
    *   Full Name: Not Found (No specific director or key contact name easily identifiable on the website's "Meet the Team" page or in search results. A previous employee, Joel Walker, was mentioned as Head of Property Management but has since moved.)

*   **Contact Information:**

*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on Sheffield student and residential lettings. They emphasize a personal approach and local knowledge. While they list on Rightmove, presence or listing counts on Zoopla and OnTheMarket were not found in the search results. Finding a specific key contact person proved difficult. There might be an alternative/previous address at 100 Matilda Street.
