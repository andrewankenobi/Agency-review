*   **Notes/Comments:** StudentTenant.com is an online platform connecting landlords, letting agents, and private student halls with students. They offer services for both landlords/providers and student tenants. They emphasize technology, including API integration for listings and tools for students like housemate matching. While they list properties on their own site, they also feed listings to other major portals like Zoopla and OnTheMarket for certain partners (e.g., student halls). A 2018 article mentioned a landlord listing appeared on Rightmove via StudentTenant.com, but their business terms state they do not post third-party agent listings onto Rightmove/Zoopla. Their primary UK office is in Liverpool. Adam Ormesher is listed as MD/CEO.
