*   **Notes/Comments:** The website `sheffieldaccommodation.co.uk` acts more like an aggregator or directory for student accommodation in Sheffield, linking out to various providers, rather than being a letting agency itself. Therefore, finding specific agency details like a key contact, branch number, or direct company LinkedIn profile is not applicable or possible through the provided URL and standard searches. Information on bills included varies depending on the actual provider linked from the site. Portal listings are general for Sheffield student accommodation, not specific to this website/entity.
