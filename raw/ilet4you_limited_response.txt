*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency is based in Sheffield and appears active on its own website and Zoopla. Information on Rightmove and OnTheMarket presence was not found in the search results. Companies House confirms Shamilah Wahab as an active director. Mohammed Rawais is listed as Director of Operations on the company website. Some listings on Zoopla are marked as student-friendly. One commercial listing mentions heating included, but it's unclear if residential listings typically include bills.
