*   **Notes/Comments:** S10 Estates appears to be a small, family-run business focused specifically on student accommodation in the S10 area of Sheffield (Broomhill, Crookes, Crookesmoor). They emphasize being local landlords. Direct listings on major portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) under the "S10 Estates" brand were not found in the search results, suggesting they might rely on their own website or other local advertising methods. The contact address is a residential address listed as the registered office on Companies House.
