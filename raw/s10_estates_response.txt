*   **Notes/Comments:** S10 Estates appears to be a family-run business specializing in student accommodation in the S10 area of Sheffield. They list properties directly on their website. No evidence found of listings on major UK property portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket). The website mentions Amein, Sami, and Nabeel Nasser as key personnel. Companies House lists Amein Nasser and Nabeel Nasser as active directors. A different address (20 Highnam Crescent Road, Sheffield S10 1BZ) is mentioned on a Wix.com version of their site, but the Pickmere Road address is the registered office.
