*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Number: Not explicitly found for Crucible Homes itself, but mentioned as a trading brand of SYHA Enterprises. GetAgent mentions a company number 09428979 associated with 'Crucible', but this needs verification. Another search found 'CRUCIBLE PROPERTY COMPANY LIMITED' with number 08611468, but it's unclear if this is the same entity. Crucible Homes is part of South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYHA), and 100% of profits go into housing and support.
*   **Notes/Comments:** Crucible Homes is an independent estate agent covering South Yorkshire (Sheffield and Rotherham). They handle sales and lettings, including new builds and shared ownership. They emphasize their social mission, reinvesting profits into affordable housing and community support. Finding a single definitive 'key contact' is difficult as they list multiple managers and team members. Chantelle Hardie is listed as General Manager on their website. Information on whether bills are included in rental listings was not found.
