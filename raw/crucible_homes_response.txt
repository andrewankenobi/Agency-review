*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Number: Not explicitly found for Crucible Homes itself, but it's noted as a trading brand of SYHA Enterprises [40]. A "CRUCIBLE PROPERTY COMPANY LIMITED" exists (08611468) [15], but its direct relation is unclear. Crucible Homes is a 'profit for purpose' business, giving 100% of profits to housing/support for vulnerable people via South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYHA) [1, 2, 7, 40]. They are partners with Forge New Homes [5].
*   **Notes/Comments:** Crucible Homes operates as an independent estate and letting agent with two main branches in South Yorkshire (Sheffield and Rotherham). They emphasize their social mission. Information on specific listing counts per portal varies or wasn't readily available in aggregate. Found conflicting information on addresses/branches (e.g., S66 vs S61 for Wickersley, the Dun Works address). Some search results referred to places named Crucible in the US (PA) [11, 21, 24, 26, 32, 35, 38].
