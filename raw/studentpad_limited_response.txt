*   **Notes/Comments:** The user initially provided "Studentpad Limited" as the agent name, but the website URL belongs to "Smart Move Sheffield". Studentpad is the software provider for the website. Smart Move Sheffield is a service run by the University of Sheffield and its Students' Union to help students find private sector accommodation. It is not a typical commercial letting agency but serves a similar function for students. Found multiple other businesses named "Smart Move" (e.g., Smart Move Estate Agents in Glasgow/Milton Keynes, Smart Move (NW) Limited, Smart Move 4 You in Scunthorpe, Smart Moves Group in Bradford), but the Sheffield entity is distinct and linked to the University. No specific key contact person was identified as it's a university service. Listings primarily appear on their own platform.
