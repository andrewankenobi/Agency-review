*   **Notes/Comments:** Smart Move Sheffield appears to be the University of Sheffield's official private sector accommodation service, rather than a standard commercial letting agency. It utilizes the Studentpad platform. The original prompt mentioned "Studentpad Limited", which is the software provider for the website, not the agency itself, although there's a clear partnership. Contact details are readily available, but specific staff names are not prominent. No evidence of listing on major commercial portals was found.
