*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Smart Move Sheffield is run by the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Students' Union. Properties listed are inspected by Sheffield City Council under the Snug scheme. The website platform appears to be powered by Studentpad Ltd (Company No: 03992911).
*   **Notes/Comments:** The user initially provided the name "Studentpad Limited". Studentpad Ltd is the company providing the software platform for the Smart Move Sheffield website, but the letting service itself is "Smart Move Sheffield", run by the University of Sheffield. Smart Move Sheffield specifically serves University of Sheffield students and staff. It primarily lists properties on its own platform, which requires properties to meet Snug accreditation standards. While some listings might include bills, it's not standard; tenants usually pay utilities separately or can opt for a third-party package like UniHomes.
