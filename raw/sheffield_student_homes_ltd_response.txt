*   **Notes/Comments:** Information specific to "Sheffield Student Homes Ltd" is very limited in the search results. The company number was found via The Gazette. Much of the search results relate to the general student accommodation market in Sheffield, other similarly named agencies (like "Student Homes Sheffield" listed on Studentpad, "Sheffield Student Property", "SDP Student Homes", "Fit Property"), or general information about bills included. The provided website URL (https://www.sheffieldstudenthomes.co.uk/) appears to be inactive or incorrect as it doesn't resolve, hindering direct verification of details like contact information, listings, and bills policy.
