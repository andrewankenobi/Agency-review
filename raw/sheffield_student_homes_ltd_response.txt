*   **Letting Agent:** Sheffield Student Homes Ltd
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (The website mentions "With both rent only and fully inclusive rental packages on offer" - although this quote is from a search result for "Sheffield Student Property" which seems to be part of JC Sales & Lettings, not Sheffield Student Homes Ltd directly. Other results discuss bills included as a general trend, especially for students. Direct confirmation for Sheffield Student Homes Ltd specifically is not found, but it's highly likely they offer some inclusive options given the market.)

*   **Notes/Comments:** The provided website URL (https://www.sheffieldstudenthomes.co.uk/) appears to redirect to a general student housing search portal (possibly Homes for Students or similar), not the specific agency's site. This makes finding direct contact information, portal listings, and specific details about their services difficult via search. The company is relatively new (incorporated Aug 2023). Contact details and portal presence are not readily available online based on the search results. The key contact person was found via Companies House.
