*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Smart Moves Group Ltd Company Number: 06220272 (Incorporated 19 April 2007, currently in Liquidation as per Endole and The Gazette). Note: The letting agency activity appears to be under "Smart Property Management Ltd", described as the rentals division of Smart Moves Group on OnTheMarket. GetAgent lists the company number 09428979, which belongs to GetAgent Limited itself, not Smart Moves Group.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on apartments in Bradford city centre and also manages student houses. There seems to be a distinction between "Smart Moves Group Ltd" (in liquidation) and the trading letting agency, potentially operating under "Smart Property Management Ltd". Multiple phone numbers are listed across different portals. The provided website URL (https://smartmovesgroup.com) leads to a New Zealand based company, not the Bradford letting agency. The UK agency does not appear to have a dedicated website easily found via search. Listings are primarily found on Zoopla and OnTheMarket.
