A petition to wind up the company was noted in The Gazette. Smart Property Management Ltd is mentioned as the rentals division.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on apartments in Bradford city centre and also manages student houses. There are conflicting addresses listed (operational vs registered office). Company status on Endole indicates potential financial distress or restructuring ("Liquidation", overdue filings, winding-up petition). Multiple companies with similar names (Smart Moves, Smartmove) exist, requiring careful differentiation.
