*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Number: 06220272 (Private limited company, Incorporated 19 April 2007). Status listed as "Liquidation" on Endole and a "Petition to wind up" notice found on The Gazette, suggesting potential financial distress or restructuring. Operates as Smart Property Management Ltd for rentals. Specialises in Bradford city centre apartments.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency seems focused on the Bradford area, particularly city centre apartments and some student housing. There are conflicting addresses (operational vs. registered office). The company status listed as "Liquidation" on Endole and the winding-up petition require careful consideration, as this indicates significant financial issues. Multiple businesses named "Smart Moves" exist in property (Inverness, Peterborough, Tarleton, Waterford) and other sectors, requiring careful differentiation. The target company is specifically the one based in Bradford with website smartmovesgroup.com.
