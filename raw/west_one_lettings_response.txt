*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** West One Lettings is part of Elmsdale Estates Ltd (Registered company address: 11 Broomgrove Rd, Sheffield, S10 2LW). They state they are property owners, not just letting agents. They manage several apartment buildings including West One, Gatecrasher, Hutton's Buildings, Broomgrove, Sellers Wheel, Niche, Porterbrook, Speedwell Works.
*   **Notes/Comments:** West One Lettings primarily manages properties owned by their parent company, focusing on student and professional accommodation in Sheffield. Contact details (phone/email) can vary depending on the specific building being inquired about. Found listings on major portals but they seem to be listed via other agents (Redbrik, Belvoir) or under the specific development name rather than "West One Lettings". Their own website lists available properties. Some sources mention "West One Student Lettings" or "West.ONE Student Accommodation Sheffield". A dissolved company "WEST ONE ACCOMMODATION LIMITED" (04336491) was found, but the current operating entity appears to be Elmsdale Estates Ltd.
