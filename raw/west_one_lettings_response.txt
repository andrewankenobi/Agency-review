*   **Notes/Comments:** West One Lettings primarily manages properties developed/owned by City Estates/Elmsdale Estates Ltd, focusing heavily on student accommodation within specific developments (West One, Gatecrasher, Hutton's Buildings, Porterbrook etc.). Listings on major portals like Zoopla/OnTheMarket seem to be handled by other agencies (e.g., Blundells, Redbrik, Belvoir) for properties within the West One development, rather than directly by West One Lettings. Some properties offer all-inclusive rent, while others explicitly state bills are excluded. Multiple contact emails are provided across different pages/developments.
