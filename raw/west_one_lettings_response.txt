A dissolved company "WEST ONE ACCOMMODATION LIMITED" (04336491) exists but seems unrelated to the current operation.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency emphasizes they own the properties they manage, primarily focusing on student accommodation in Sheffield city centre. Information suggests they are part of a larger property group (City Estates/Elmsdale Estates Ltd). Multiple contact emails were found. Bills inclusion varies by property type.
