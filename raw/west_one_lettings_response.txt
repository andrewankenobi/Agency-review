*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency seems to operate with different contact details (phone/email) and managers depending on the specific building or property type being managed, although the central office address is consistent. Finding a single primary contact person is difficult due to the listed office managers for different segments. Bills included options are available but may depend on the specific contract/property. Older sources mention Andrea Jenkinson as potentially linked, possibly at a director level for a related company, but current operational managers are listed as Karen Fox, Alistair Macdonald, and Emma Chappell.
