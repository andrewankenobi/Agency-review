*   **Notes/Comments:** Information primarily sourced from the agency's website and directory listings. The founder's name (Symon Donovan) is mentioned on the "About Us" page. No listings found on major UK property portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket) via search, suggesting they may primarily list on their own site or other student-specific platforms. The website indicates they manage over 60 properties, but the live search shows 52. Some properties offer bills included, while others have a bills package available.
