*   **Notes/Comments:** MAF Properties specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield. While their website mentions they are registered with Sheffield University, direct listings on major portals like Rightmove/Zoopla were not confirmed in the search. They list properties on OnTheMarket and AccommodationforStudents.co.uk. Bills are not included in rent as standard but can be arranged separately. A company named MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED exists with Mahboob Ahmed Fazal as an officer, likely associated with the letting agency. No specific 'About Us' page or key contact person details were found on the website itself. Found references to MAF Finance Group, but this appears to be a separate entity.
