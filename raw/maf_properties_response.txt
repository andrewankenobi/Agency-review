*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Name: MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED, Company Number: 11297260 (Incorporated 6 April 2018, listed as dormant on Endole, but active on Companies House). Directors listed on Companies House: Mahboob Ahmed Fazal (Appointed 6 April 2018), Masaud Ahmed Fazal (Appointed 23 March 2007 - likely related to the business operating for 30+ years, potentially under a different structure before this specific company number).
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield and has been operating for over 30 years. They state they manage their own properties. While utility bills are not included in the standard rent, they partner with UniHomes to offer all-inclusive packages. Finding specific LinkedIn profiles for this UK student letting agency was difficult due to the common name "MAF Properties" shared with larger international groups (Majid Al Futtaim) and other UK finance brokers (MAF Finance Group). Company information suggests MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED (11297260) is the current entity, though its incorporation date (2018) doesn't align with the claimed 30+ years of operation, suggesting prior business structures.
