*   **Letting Agent:** MAF Properties
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Listings on Rightmove mention "Free Internet" or "Free Wifi" for some properties, but it's unclear if other bills are included. General searches indicate 'bills included' is a popular search term, but MAF's website doesn't explicitly state this for all listings.)

*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove, OnTheMarket, Studentpad (Zoopla lists MAF Properties but shows no live listings currently)
*   **Branches:** 1 (Based on the single address found)
*   **Key Contact Person:**
    *   Full Name: Mahboob Ahmed Fazal (Listed as a director for MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED on Companies House and Endole)
    *   Position: Director (Likely, based on company filings)
*   **Contact Information:**

*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED, Company Number: 11295087 (Incorporated 6 April 2018, listed as dormant on Endole, but active on Companies House)
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield. They state they own all their properties. Finding specific key contact details beyond the likely director listed on Companies House was difficult. Many search results relate to Majid Al Futtaim (MAF) Group/Properties, which is a large international conglomerate and unrelated to this Sheffield-based student letting agency. The website mafstudents.co.uk is the primary source, along with portal listings.
