*   **Notes/Comments:** MAF Properties focuses on student accommodation in Sheffield, owning their properties. They are registered with Sheffield Universities and local landlord associations. Contact details are consistent across their website and portal listings. Difficulty finding specific key contact person details beyond the likely owner from company registration. No dedicated LinkedIn profile found for this specific UK student letting agency. Some search results confused MAF Properties (UK) with Majid Al Futtaim (MAF) Properties (Dubai-based) or MAF Finance Group.
