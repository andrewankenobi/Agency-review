*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** The website's privacy policy mentions UNI Services (UK) Ltd (Company No: 11308745) with the same address. There is also a dormant company named MAF PROPERTIES ( UK ) LIMITED (Company No: 11294488) registered at a different Sheffield address. The relationship between these entities and the trading name MAF Properties is unclear from the search results. MAF Properties is a member of the Property Redress Scheme (PRS).
*   **Notes/Comments:** MAF Properties specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield and manages its own properties. They do not include bills as standard but can arrange packages. Finding specific leadership or a dedicated LinkedIn profile for this specific letting agency was difficult due to similarly named, larger international companies (Majid Al Futtaim, MAF Finance Group).
