*   **Notes/Comments:** Steel City Living appears to be a small, independent letting agent specializing in student accommodation in popular Sheffield areas like Ecclesall Road and Crookesmoor. Their website emphasizes their focus on student lettings. Direct contact information (phone/email) is available, but specific details like branch count, key personnel, and listings on major portals were not found in the search results. The website mentions properties are managed but doesn't specify if they have a physical office address. Some search results refer to "Steel City" as a specific student accommodation building or other unrelated businesses, requiring careful filtering.
