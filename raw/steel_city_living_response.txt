*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student accommodation in popular Sheffield areas like Ecclesall Road, Crookesmoor, Crookes, and near SHU City Campus. They emphasize being a small, independent agent providing high-standard, modern properties with a dedicated maintenance team. Many search results referred to a different entity named "Steel City", which appears to be a large, purpose-built student accommodation block in Sheffield, not the letting agency "Steel City Living". Found contact details and address primarily through the website's footer and privacy policy. No specific key contact person or director name readily available beyond a first name in a testimonial. No presence found on major portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) or LinkedIn.
