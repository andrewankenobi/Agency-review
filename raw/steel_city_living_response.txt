*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student accommodation in popular Sheffield areas like Ecclesall Road, Crookesmoor, Crookes, and near SHU City Campus. They emphasize being a small, independent agent offering quality properties and responsive service. Some search results confuse "Steel City Living" (the agency) with "Steel City" (a specific student accommodation building/development in Sheffield, e.g., on Garden Street, managed by others like Future Generation or EVO Student). The agency's website mentions finding them on "StuRents". No clear information on whether bills are included as standard across their portfolio. No specific key contact person identified.
