*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student properties in Sheffield, particularly in areas like Ecclesall Road, Crookesmoor, Crookes, and near SHU City Campus. They emphasize being a small, independent agent with a dedicated maintenance team. Search results frequently confused "Steel City Living" (the letting agent) with "Steel City" (a specific student accommodation building in Sheffield managed by other companies like Future Generation/Evo Student/Homes for Students). No listings found on major portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) via search, though this doesn't definitively mean they aren't listed. Contact details primarily sourced from their website's Privacy Notice.
