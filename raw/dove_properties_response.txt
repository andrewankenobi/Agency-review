*   **Notes/Comments:** Established in 1993, Dove Properties is a family-owned letting agent specializing in student and residential lettings in Sheffield. They were awarded the Sheffield City Council "Letting Agent of the Year" award (date not specified, but referred to as the 'most recent'). They have a separate website for residential lettings (doveproperties.co.uk). Found multiple related company names on Companies House (Dove Management (Properties) Limited, Dove Management Lettings Limited) with overlapping directors/secretaries, but Dove Properties and Estates Limited appears to be the main trading entity.
