*   **Notes/Comments:** The company name "PJ Properties & Consultancy Limited" (Company No: 04128133) has its registered office in London and Director Peter Johnson. However, the website pjproperties.co.uk refers to "PJ Properties", a family-run student letting specialist in Sheffield since 1983, operating from a Broomhill office. It also mentions "PJ Residential Investments Limited - Property Consultancy". It's highly likely the Sheffield operation trades as "PJ Properties" but is legally linked to "PJ Properties & Consultancy Limited". The London contact details are likely for the registered office, while the Sheffield details (phone 0114 266 7666, Broomhill office) are for the operational letting agency. Bills included are offered via UniHomes. Listings on major portals like Rightmove/Zoopla are implied but not explicitly confirmed.
