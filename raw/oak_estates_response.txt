Several other agencies named "Oak Estates" or similar exist (e.g., in Watford, London, Bristol), which appeared in search results but are distinct entities. Information on key portals and LinkedIn specifically for the Sheffield branch (oakestates.net) was limited. Zoopla confirms the Sheffield branch (S11) and its focus on student lettings. No specific information found regarding whether bills are included in their listings.
