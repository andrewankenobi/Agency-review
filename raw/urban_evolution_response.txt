*   **Notes/Comments:** The company operates as Urban Evolution Lettings and Urban Evolution Property Management Ltd. They specialize in new-build residential and student accommodation. Multiple phone numbers and addresses found, likely corresponding to different branches or departments (Lettings vs Block Management). Found several staff names on allAgents but no clear single 'key contact' beyond the Directors/Head of Lettings. Bills included seems common, especially for student properties. Website emphasizes chatbot for contact.
