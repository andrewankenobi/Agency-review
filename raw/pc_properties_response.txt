*   **Notes/Comments:** The search results frequently returned information for "Hull Property Centre" (hullpc.com) and "Pacific Court Hull" (pacificcourt.com), which seem unrelated to PC Properties (pcproperties.co.uk) based in Sheffield. PC Properties appears to specialize in student accommodation in Sheffield. No company number or VAT number was found directly associated with "PC Properties" on their website, unlike the Hull Property Centre results. Difficulty finding listings on major portals suggests they may rely more on their own website or other student-specific platforms.
