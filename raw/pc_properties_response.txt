*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Appears to be a family-run business with over 20 years of experience, specializing in student and professional lettings in Sheffield (S10 & S11 areas). Voted 'Landlord of the Year' multiple times in Sheffield Landlord Awards.

*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses heavily on the Sheffield student market. They emphasize their local knowledge and maintenance service. Finding specific listing counts on major portals was unsuccessful; they may rely primarily on their own website and local reputation. There are other companies with similar names (e.g., PC Lettings in Barrow/Ulverston, PC Properties (SW) Ltd in Cornwall), but the provided URL clearly points to the Sheffield-based agency.
