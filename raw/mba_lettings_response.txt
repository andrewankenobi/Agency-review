*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency specializes in student and professional lettings in Sheffield, particularly around the Broomhill area. They emphasize their experience (over 15 years) and regulation by RICS/ARLA. Two different addresses were found (221 Fulwood Road and 501 Glossop Road), though both are in Broomhill, Sheffield. 221 Fulwood Road is listed on their website's contact page. 501 Glossop Road appears on the RICS directory and older site references/surveyor side of the business. Mark Bennett is mentioned as MD on Rightmove, Sally Williams as Director/Property Manager on RICS and another site (Studio Hundreds). Listings were confirmed on Rightmove but not easily found/quantified on Zoopla or OTM for this specific agency. Some listings explicitly mention bills included or partially included.
