*   **Notes/Comments:** Claypenny specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield, particularly around Ecclesall Road, Broomhall, and other popular student areas. They emphasize their family-run nature and customer service. Listings on major portals like Rightmove/Zoopla were not found in the search results; they seem to rely on their own website and possibly other student-specific platforms. Some listings explicitly state "exc bills" and "inc bills" pricing options.
