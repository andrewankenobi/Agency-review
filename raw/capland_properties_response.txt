*   **Notes/Comments:** Specializes in student accommodation in Sheffield (Ecclesall Road, Broomhill, Broomhall, Crookesmoor, City Centre). The website URL provided (capland.co.uk) redirects to capland.co.uk/sheffield. Initial search results mentioned a Leeds address (128 Woodhouse Lane, LS2 9EN) and phone (0113 245 0011) but the primary website, contact details, Companies House registration, and recent blog posts all point strongly to Sheffield operations under company number 03854195 with Rex Caplan as a director. There might be or have been a separate Leeds operation, potentially under a different company structure (e.g., CAPLAND PROPERTIES LTD, company number 02400311, registered in Leeds with different directors), but the provided website focuses solely on Sheffield.
