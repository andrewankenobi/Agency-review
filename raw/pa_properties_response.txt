*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student and professional lettings in Sheffield. It appears to be an independent family business operating for nearly 40 years. Finding specific key personnel or a dedicated UK LinkedIn profile was difficult due to commonality of the name "PA Properties" (including a large developer in the Philippines and unrelated US/PA entities). Bills inclusion varies by property. Presence confirmed on UniHomes and StuRents.
