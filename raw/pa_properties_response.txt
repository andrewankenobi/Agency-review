*   **Notes/Comments:** Pa Properties appears to be a landlord that owns its properties rather than a traditional agency [3]. They specialize in student and professional lettings in Sheffield [3]. Search results often confused this UK agency with others named "PA Properties" or "Pennsylvania Properties" in the US and elsewhere [2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]. No listings were found on major UK portals like Rightmove or Zoopla via search, suggesting they may rely on their own website and potentially other channels like UniHomes (mentioned on their site) [5].
