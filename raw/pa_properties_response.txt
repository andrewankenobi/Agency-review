*   **Notes/Comments:** Pa Properties appears to be a landlord owning their properties rather than just an agency, specializing in student and professional lettings in Sheffield. They emphasize direct dealing, not through agents. Their website lists key team members: Susan (Managing Director), Christina (Property Manager), Georgina (Assistant Property Manager), Leanne (Accounts), Nathan (Maintenance). Many search results referred to unrelated entities like "Pennsylvania Properties", "PA Housing", or "PA Alvarez Properties".
