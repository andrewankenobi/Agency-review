*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student and professional lettings in Sheffield. They emphasize direct landlord service rather than acting as agents for others. Search results were heavily mixed with companies named "PA Properties" or similar in Pennsylvania (USA) and other locations, requiring careful filtering. No specific listings found on major UK portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) via search, but they partner with UniHomes. Key contact person identified only by first name from testimonials.
