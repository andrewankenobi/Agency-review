*   **Notes/Comments:** The website focuses heavily on the Sheffield student letting operation ("PJ Properties"), established in 1983. The limited company "PJ Properties & Consultancy Limited" was incorporated in 2000 with a London registered address and a director named Peter Johnson. It's unclear if the Sheffield operation is a trading style of the London-registered company or a separate but related entity. The Sheffield office is described as being in the centre of Broomhill. They specialize in student accommodation in Sheffield.
