*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency focuses on student and young professional lettings in London and Sheffield. They manage a large portfolio and emphasize 'smart-living concepts'. The registered office recently changed to Sheffield. Finding a specific key contact person or general email address was difficult through public search. The company name appears as both "Urban and Campus Nest Ltd." and "UCNestLDN Ltd." on their website and Companies House. Search results often confused this agency with "Urbanest", a different student accommodation provider.
