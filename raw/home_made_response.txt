*   **Letting Agent:** Home Made
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (Some listings on portals like Rightmove mention "Bills included" or "Services included", but it's not universal across all listings or explicitly stated as standard practice on their website. Renters should check individual listings and tenancy agreements.)

*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (Listings marketed by Home Made appear on student accommodation searches on portals like OnTheMarket, though their main website doesn't have a dedicated student section.)

*   **Branches:** Not Found (They state they don't have expensive high street branches and operate across cities like London, Manchester, and Liverpool from a central base, likely their London office.)
*   **Key Contact Person:**
    *   Full Name: Not Found (Specific key contact person like CEO/Director not readily found in search results.)

    *   Company Profile URL: https://www.linkedin.com/company/home-made-com/ (Inferred from Zoopla social links, requires verification)
    *   Key Contact Profile URL: Not Found
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Company Number: Not Found (Not listed on website footer or easily found via search. "Accent Homemade Limited" found with Company number 05591747, but this appears to be a different entity focused on shared ownership under Accent Housing, not the letting agency Home Made at home-made.com). Registered with The Property Redress Scheme and Client Money Protect scheme.
*   **Notes/Comments:** Home Made positions itself as a "proptech lettings and management company" focused on using technology to offer lower fees than traditional high street agents. They operate in London, Manchester, and Liverpool, with plans to expand. While specific listing counts on Rightmove/OnTheMarket weren't immediately available, Zoopla shows a significant number (491). Finding a specific key contact person or company number proved difficult through standard searches. Their website emphasizes landlord services and build-to-rent partnerships.
