*   **Notes/Comments:** Thornsett Properties focuses heavily on student accommodation in Sheffield, close to both universities. They emphasize being direct landlords rather than agents. Multiple individuals are listed as Directors or key contacts across different sources (website, Companies House, Endole, testimonials). Finding listings on major portals like Zoopla and OTM was difficult as searches returned properties *in* the area of Thornsett rather than *by* Thornsett Properties agency. Rightmove listings were confirmed.
