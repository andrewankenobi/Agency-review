They emphasize being property owners with an in-house maintenance team.

Listings were confirmed on Rightmove via Home.co.uk and Rightmove itself, but not found directly on Zoopla or OnTheMarket during this search (though some unrelated properties in areas named "Thornsett" appeared). Some city centre properties offer bills-inclusive packages.
