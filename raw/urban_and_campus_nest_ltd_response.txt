*   **Notes/Comments:** The company operates under the name UCNEST and is registered as UCNestLDN Ltd. on their website, but the official company name is Urban and Campus Nest Ltd. They specialize in student and young professional lettings in London and Sheffield. They received Seed funding in 2017. Search results often confused this agency with "Urbanest" (a large student accommodation provider) and "Urban Nest" or "Urban Campus" (other unrelated entities). No direct listings found on major UK portals like Rightmove or Zoopla during this search, suggesting they may rely more on their own platform and potentially other channels like SpareRoom or specific student accommodation sites.
