*   **Notes/Comments:** UCNEST specializes in student and young professional lettings in London and Sheffield, managing over 1100 individuals annually. They focus on properties with "smart-living concepts". [20, 27] Finding specific listings on major UK portals (Rightmove, Zoopla, OTM) was unsuccessful. Contact details beyond a London phone number are limited on their site. There seems to be a discrepancy between the requested name "Urban and Campus Nest Ltd." and the company name listed on the website "UCNestLDN Ltd.".
