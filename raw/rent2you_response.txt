*   **Letting Agent:** Rent2You (also referred to as Rent 2 You)
*   **Bills Included on Listings?:** Some (The website mentions "all inclusive packages" for landlords, and some property portals allow filtering by "bills included", but it's not explicitly stated for all tenant listings on the Rent2You site itself. UniHomes, where they advertise, specializes in bills-included student homes.)
*   **Website Url:** https://rent2you.org
*   **Student Listings Live:** Yes (Mentioned on Yell.com and OnTheMarket profiles, and they advertise on UniHomes which is student-focused)
*   **Key channels live on:** Rightmove, Zoopla, OnTheMarket, UniHomes, PrimeLocation
*   **Branches:** Not Found (Appears to be primarily based in Sheffield, but no specific branch number found. An address on OnTheMarket suggests one location.)
*   **Key Contact Person:**
    *   Full Name: Gina (Surname not found, mentioned in reviews as the owner)
    *   Position: Owner (Inferred from reviews)
*   **Contact Information:**

    *   Email: hello@rent2you.org
*   **LinkedIn:**
    *   Company Profile URL: Not Found (A LinkedIn icon exists on the website but doesn't link. Searches for Rent2You yield results for companies in other countries/sectors.)
    *   Key Contact Profile URL: Not Found
*   **Other Linkedin/Extra Details:** Primarily serves the Sheffield area. Focuses on an "all-inclusive" service for landlords.
*   **Notes/Comments:** The agency seems focused on the Sheffield rental market, including student accommodation. While they advertise on major portals, finding specific company details like branch numbers or key contact full names/LinkedIn profiles proved difficult. There are multiple businesses globally with similar names (Rent2You/Rent2U) in car rental, app development, and real estate in other countries (Saudi Arabia, Rotterdam, Malaysia), requiring careful filtering of search results. The OnTheMarket profile provides a specific address and an alternative phone number. Reviews mention "Gina" as the owner.
